<h1>Contestant VM Manual</h1>

<p>This page contains information about using the Contestant VM.</p>

<p>There is only one normal user account in the Contestant VM for the
Contestant to use. The username is <code>ioi</code> with default password
<code>ioi</code>.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>At your first login to the Contestant VM, and every subsequent login as long
as you do not complete this step, you will be prompted to run the IOI Setup
script. You can also re-run IOI Setup by running <code>ioisetup</code> from the
Terminal</p>

<p>The IOI Setup script will request your Contestant credentials, then download
and install a VPN configuration. The UNIX "gecos real name" is also updated
with your Contestant ID, e.g.  XXX1, which will be displayed in the top right
corner on subsequent logins.</p>

<p>The VPN connection identifies this VM instance to the IOI 2021 Online
Contest Environment as being associated to the configured Contestant. If
another Contestant takes over the use of this VM instance, you must re-run IOI
Setup with the other Contestant's credentials.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> There must be only <em>one</em> VM instance running and
connected to the IOI 2021 Online Contest Environment per Contestant. If the
same Contestant is logged in more than once, the VPN connection will flap
between the two instances and will <em>not</em> be usable.</p>

<p>You <em>may</em> change the <code>ioi</code> local user account password in
the Contestant VM. This does <em>not</em> change the official Contestant
Credentials given the Contestants.</p>

<h2>Online Connection</h2>

<p>The Contestant VM must be running and connected to the IOI 2021 Online
Contest Environment no later than 4 hours before Contest starts, or no later
than 1 hour before Practice starts. The HTC will access the Contestant VM
remotely to perform verification checks and to apply any necessary updates.
Delays caused to the HTC will mean a late start for the Contestant.</p>

<p>The Contestant VM must remain connected after end of Contest and Practice
for the HTC's continued access to download logs and other data. Instructions
will be conveyed through the Proctors once the online connection is no longer
required, and thereafter, the Contestant VM may be shutdown.</p>

<h2>Account Reprovisining</h2>

<p>The <code>ioi</code> user account will be removed and reprovisioned
automatically 15 minutes before Contest or Practice starts. Users who are
logged in at that time will be forcibly logged out. Contestants may relogin
after the account has been reprovisioned. The screen will be locked
automatically after login, and unlocked at Contest or Practice start.</p>

<p>Note that the account reprovisioning does <em>not</em> revert the
<code>ioi</code> password to the default. I.e., if you have changed the
<code>ioi</code> account password, your new password is still effective.</p>

<h2>Local Configuration</h2>

<p>The following settings can be configured in the VM. These settings will persist through
account re-provisioning.</p>

<h3>Home Directory Backup</h3>

<p>The Contestant VM provides a backup/replication mechanism that uses rsync to
replicate the home directory to a backup server in the IOI 2021 Online
Contest Environment. This is <em>not</em> enabled by default. Contestants can
either:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Run the <code>ioibackup</code> script at any time to perform the rsync.</li>
	<li>Run <code>ioiconf setautobackup on</code> to enable automatic backup at a
	5-minute interval. A random delay up to 30 seconds in inserted before automatic
	backup. Run <code>ioiconf setautobackup off</code> to disable automatic backup.</li>
</ol>

<p>Backups are available only during Contest and Practice time.</p>

<p>This backup is more accurately described as replication. It uses rsync with the --delete
option, which means the remote contents are a mirror of the local home directory. In
particular, files deleted locally will also be removed at the remote. This replication only
includes non-hidden files up to a maximum size of 1 MB.</p>

<p>To restore or retrieve files from remote, run <code>ioibackup -r</code>. The files will
be restored in <code>/tmp/restore</code>.</p>

<h3>Automatic Screen Lock</h3>

<p>Automatic screen lock is enabled by default, with a 30 second delay after 15 minutes of
idle time. You can disable automatic screen lock by running
<code>ioiconf setscreenlock off</code>. Run <code>ioiconf setscreenlock on</code> to
renable automatic screen lock.</p>

<h3>Timezone</h3>

<p>The Contestant VM is configured to show time in the Asia/Singapore timezone.
All dates and times communicated by the IOI 2021 organisers will be in
Asia/Singapore timezone unless otherwise specified.</p>

<p>If you strongly prefer to see the time in your local timezone, you can run
<code>ioiconf settz &lt;timezone&gt;</code>, where
<code>&lt;timezone&gt;</code> is an apporiate TZ specification (according to
<code>tzselect</code>). The changes will be effected the next time you login to
the <code>ioi</code> account.</p>

<p>E.g.: <code>ioiconf settz UTC</code> to use GMT time.</p>

<h3>VPN Protocol Mode</h3>

<p>By default, the VPN is configured to use TCP on port 655 only. The VPN
software, Tinc, can also use UDP on port 655 for data packets, in addition to
using TCP on port 655 for metadata. This may improve performance, provided your
network permits UDP port 655 traffic outbound and inbound. This mode can be
enabled by running <code>ioiconf setvpnproto auto</code>, then <code>ioiconf
vpnrestart</code> (or restart the Contestant VM).</p>

<p>In auto mode, both TCP/UDP will be used, with automatic fallback to
TCP-only. To revert to the default TCP-only setting, run <code>ioiconf
setvpnproto tcp</code>, then <code>ioiconf vpnrestart</code> (or restart the
Contestant VM).</p>

<p>Note that the VPN protocol mode will return to default if the VPN is re-setup
(i.e. by re-running <code>ioisetup</code>).</p>
